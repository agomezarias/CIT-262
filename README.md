# Alberto Gomez

Hi my name is Alberto Gomez, I am originally from Chihuahua, Mexico but was raised in Colorado from the age of 3. I lived there until I was 28 and then my family and I moved to Fort Worth, Texas and we have been here for 6 years going on 7. I look forward to learning something new every day.
